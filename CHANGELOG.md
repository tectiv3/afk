## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added

-   **Read-Only Mode**: New operating mode for passive monitoring without workflow interference
    -   Enable with `afk readonly` command or `/afk:readonly` slash command
    -   Sends notifications for completed sessions without blocking or waiting for responses
    -   Perfect for monitoring long-running tasks without delays
    -   Operates independently from local/remote toggle cycle
-   **Enhanced Mode Management**: Three distinct operating modes with clear purposes
    -   **Local Mode**: Default Claude behavior with built-in prompts
    -   **Remote Mode**: Full Telegram approval workflow with interactive buttons
    -   **Read-Only Mode**: Passive notifications without intervention
-   **Improved Toggle Behavior**: Toggle command now cycles only between local and remote modes
    -   Read-only mode requires explicit activation via dedicated command
    -   Maintains predictable toggle behavior while adding monitoring capability
-   **Updated CLI and Slash Commands**: Full support for read-only mode
    -   New `afk readonly` CLI command
    -   New `/afk:readonly` slash command for Claude Code interface
    -   Updated help documentation and command descriptions

### Changed

-   Toggle behavior now cycles between local ↔ remote only (read-only is separate)
-   Updated notification formatting to clearly indicate read-only mode with special prefixes
-   Enhanced help text and documentation to explain all three operating modes
-   Improved mode status display with tips for switching between all modes

### Fixed

-   Resolved Utils class instantiation issue causing cryptoRandomId function errors
-   PreToolUse hook now correctly handles read-only mode without intervention

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-30

### Added

-   **Heartbeat-based session expiration**: Sessions now actively report their status via heartbeats
    -   Heartbeat updates occur every second during polling
    -   Sessions marked as expired only when heartbeat stops (2 seconds timeout)
    -   Prevents false "expired" messages while hooks are actively waiting
-   **Automatic hook cancellation**: Hooks automatically exit when switching from remote to local mode
    -   No more hanging hooks when toggling modes
    -   Immediate response to mode changes

### Changed

-   Session expiration detection now based on heartbeat instead of creation time
-   Removed auto-guessing for message routing - only explicit Reply button clicks accepted
-   Simplified message handling logic for better predictability

### Fixed

-   Sessions no longer show as "expired" while actively waiting for approval
-   Mode switching now properly cancels all pending approval requests
